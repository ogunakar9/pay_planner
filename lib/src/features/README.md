# Features Directory

This directory contains all feature modules of the app. Each feature should have its own folder containing its views, controllers, and related files. This modular approach helps with scalability and long-term maintenance.

Example structure:

- home/
  - home_view.dart
  - home_controller.dart
- settings/
  - settings_view.dart
  - settings_controller.dart
